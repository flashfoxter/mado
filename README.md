# Mado

Mado is simple utility app that runs on the background and allows you to tag individual windows and then return back to them with a press of a hotkey.

This is mostly useful for fullscreen workflow where switching to correct window might take multiple presses of `Alt + Tab` or clicking on a app within a dock.

Hotkeys:
* `Cmd + Alt + NUMBER` to tag a window.
* `Alt + NUMBER` to focus the previously tagged window.

Where `NUMBER` is key from 1 to 5.
